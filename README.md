## Features
**Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numeric features.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Provides insights into the dataset through visualizations and statistical analysis.
**Modeling:** Implements various machine learning models to predict dementia status.
**Evaluation:** Compares model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Key Components
1. **Data Preparation:**
- Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.
- Handling missing data and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
-Statistical summaries of the data.
-Visualizations such as histograms, correlation heatmaps, and box plots to understand feature relationships.
3. **Machine Learning Models:**
- Various models like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines are trained.
- Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation.
4. **Performance Evaluation:**
- Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix are used to assess models.
